# Guide to Contributing
Thanks for tuning in to Musi! ðŸŽ§
Weâ€™re so excited to have you join the jam session. Every great track needs collaboration â€” and your contributions help us make Musi even better!

## Team Values
At Musi, we value open communication, accountability, and collaboration. Every team member plays a role in ensuring that our workflow runs smoothly and that everyone stays aligned throughout the development cycle. Those who repeatedly fail to communicate or fulfill their responsibilities will not be recognized for their contributions.
- Be proactive in sharing updates on your progress and blockers during meetings.
- If you anticipate delays or challenges, communicate them early so the team can plan accordingly.
- Respect the sprint timeline, complete your assigned tasks or provide a status update before each standup.

## Sprint cadence and Standups
Sprints are ~2 weeks longs. 
Meetings will take place during the following times:
- Mondays 4:00-4:30 PM, sychronously.
- Thursdays 4:00-4:30 PM sychronously.
- Saturdays, asychronously.
All team members are expected to be present and present synchronously. We will share all updates on Discord.
Members will not cover for other members who do not participate.
Members who do not make any progress on a given task for 2 or more meetings will be reported to management.

## Coding Standards
- Work will be done using VScode and pylint.
- Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the main branch of code.
- Only push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
- Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
- Provide descriptive commit messages.
- Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
- Don't leave dead/commented out code behind.
- Run all linting and tests before opening a Pull Request, and address review feedback promptly.

## Reporting bugs
Before opening an issue to report a bug, make sure you do the following:
- Check that you are on the newest version of Musi
- Check the documentation for known behavior
- Check if others have already reported the bug
Include the following in the report:
- OS, Platform and Version
- If possible, a reliable method to reproduce the issue
