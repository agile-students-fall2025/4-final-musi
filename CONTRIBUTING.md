# Guide to Contributing
Thank you for taking time to contribute to MUSI.

## Team Values
- 

## Sprint cadence and Standups
Sprints are ~2 weeks longs. 
Meetings will take place during the following times:
- Mondays 4:00-4:30 PM
- Thursdays 4:00-4:30 PM
All team members are expected to be present and present synchronously. 
Members will not cover for other members who do not participate.
Members who do not make any progress on a given task for 2 or more meetings will be reported to management.

## Coding Standards
- Work will be done using VScode and pylint.
- Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the main branch of code.
- Only push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
- Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
- Provide descriptive commit messages.
- Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
- Don't leave dead/commented out code behind.
- Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality.

## Reporting bugs
Before opening an issue to report a bug, make sure you do the following:
- Check that you are on the newest version of Musi
- Check the documentation for known behavior
- Check if others have already reported the bug
Include the following in the report:
- OS, Platform and Version
- If possible, a reliable method to reproduce the issue
