# MUSI
Musi is an app where users can rank their favorite songs, create personal lists, and share their music taste with others. Current music platforms make it easy to listen but not to express how much you like a song or compare preferences. By allowing users to share ranked lists and compare profiles with friends, Musi makes music more social and helps people discover new songs through each other.

## Why work on Musi
Musi came to be because current music platforms aren't able to capture the social aspect of music. It might be easy to listen to any song you want on a streaming platform, but it's much harder to know what your friends are listening to. Musi helps you express your music tastes to your friends and let them know what you're listening to.
